# ImageEnhance-TextRec-OCR

Image enhancement plays a crucial role in advancing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, applied widely across domains for accurate text extraction, especially from sensitive personal documents. Challenges such as noise, variable illumination, and low-quality scans often result in distortions and reduced resolution during text recognition. The study includes a comparative analysis involving image filtering with OpenCV, the application of the BSRGAN super-resolution model, and leveraging EasyOCR for character extraction. Validation of the proposed method is conducted through extensive experiments on three datasets: the Brazilian Identity Document (BID), IIIT 5K-Word, and SVHN, to simulate real-world conditions. 

### Main Technologies
- EasyOCR: Solution for optical character recognition and text extraction from images.
- CRAFT-PyTorch: Framework used in BID dataset to precisely localize text regions in images.
- Huggingface: Library used to downloaded datasets.
- OpenCV: Framework for image processing.
